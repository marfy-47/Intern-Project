üîê Backend - JWT & Spring Security
Today, I focused on enhancing the security of the Appointment System backend using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and Spring Security. This allows us to implement stateless authentication and protect our endpoints effectively.

‚úÖ Backend Highlights:
Integrated JWT-based authentication to secure REST APIs.

Configured Spring Security for:

Custom login and registration endpoints.

Securing routes based on user roles (e.g., Admin, Patient, Doctor).

Implemented JWT generation upon login and token validation for every request.

Created security filters and exception handlers to manage unauthorized access.

üåê Frontend - Thymeleaf Integration
I also worked on integrating a Thymeleaf-based frontend directly into the Spring Boot project. This enables server-side rendering of views and tight coupling with backend logic.

‚úÖ Frontend Highlights:
Set up Thymeleaf templates for:

Login

Registration

Basic dashboard layout

Integrated forms with Spring Controllers for authentication and registration.

Handled JWT token processing and passed necessary authentication data to backend services.

Basic UI elements built for form submission and feedback messages.
