# Java Learning Progress ðŸš€

## ðŸ“š What I Did

Iâ€™ve been actively improving my Java development skills through hands-on learning and problem-solving. Here's a quick summary of what I've been up to:

---

## ðŸŒ± Spring Boot Documentation

- ðŸ“– **Read and studied official Spring Boot documentation** to understand:
  - Spring Boot starters and auto-configuration
  - RESTful web services using Spring Boot
  - Application properties and YAML configuration
  - Dependency injection and component scanning
  - Integration with databases (JPA & H2/MySQL)
  - Running Spring Boot applications and using Spring Initializr

> ðŸ“Œ Spring Boot is a key part of modern Java development, and understanding it deeply will help in building scalable web apps and microservices.

## ðŸ’» Java Practice on HackerRank

- âœ… **Solved multiple Java challenges on HackerRank** focusing on:
  - Input/Output handling
  - Data types and type ranges (byte, short, int, long)
  - String manipulation and formatting
  - Loops, conditionals, and control flow
  - Working with Scanner, BufferedReader, and exception handling

> ðŸ§  This helped reinforce core Java concepts and improve my problem-solving ability using real-world-style coding challenges.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- Java (JDK 17+)
- IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code
- HackerRank platform
- Spring Boot official documentation ([docs.spring.io](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/))

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps

- Build a simple Spring Boot REST API project
- Explore advanced Spring features: Security, Validation, Testing
- Continue solving medium/hard-level HackerRank problems in Java
