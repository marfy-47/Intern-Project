ðŸ“Œ What is SOLID?
SOLID is a set of five design principles that help developers write clean, maintainable, and scalable code:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

"A class should have only one reason to change."

Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

"Software should be open for extension but closed for modification."

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

"Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes."

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

"Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they donâ€™t use."

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

"Depend on abstractions, not concretions."
